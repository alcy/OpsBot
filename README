OpsBot integrates with different pieces of your infra, modeled as plugins to provide information from those pieces & facilitate communication among ops.

Currently jabber has been provided as the communication plugin, but plugins can be written for any comm medium, like irc etc. The main purpose of these is to 
just get a message, find which plugin to send it to for further processing, and get the processed output back & send it.
